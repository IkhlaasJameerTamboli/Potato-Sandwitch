2. Take 8 to 10 bread slices on a chopping board. Spread softened butter generously on them. Place some of the spiced potato stuffing on the buttered bread slices.


To make these sandwiches spicy and more flavorsome you can opt to spread some coriander chutney or mint chutney on the butter.

3. Top with grated cheese if required. You can use cheddar cheese or processed cheese or mozzarella cheese. Or a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I have used cheddar cheese.

If you are not fond of cheese then you can skip adding them. The addition of cheese makes the sandwich more filling.

5. In a pre heated grill or panini press, place the aloo sandwich carefully with the buttered side facing down, making sure your hands donâ€™t touch the grill.

Note: Be careful when doing this. If you cannot do this then just skip the above step. Instead spread butter once the sandwiches are grilled.

Now spread butter on the top side which is facing you.
